# CS360-Weight_Tracking_app

Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?

The weight tracking app I developed with SQLite is a simple but effective tool for users to track their weight and progress over time. The app allows users to log their weight daily, weekly, or monthly, and view their progress in a variety of ways, including charts, graphs, and statistics. The app also includes a goal setting feature, so users can set their own weight loss or gain goals and track their progress towards those goals.

The app was designed to address the needs of users who are trying to lose weight, gain weight, or simply maintain a healthy weight. The app can help users stay motivated and on track with their weight loss or gain goals, and it can also help them identify trends and patterns in their weight data.

What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?

The app includes the following screens and features:

A main screen where users can view their current weight, their progress towards their goal weight, and a chart of their weight history.
A logging screen where users can log their weight and any other relevant information, such as their body fat percentage or waist circumference.
A statistics screen where users can view detailed statistics about their weight data, such as their average weight loss or gain per week, their highest and lowest weight, and their BMI.
A goal setting screen where users can set their own weight loss or gain goals.
When designing the app's UI, I kept the following user-centered design principles in mind:

Clarity: The UI should be clear and easy to understand, with clear labels and instructions.
Consistency: The UI should be consistent throughout the app, with the same elements and design patterns used in the same way on every screen.
Efficiency: The UI should be efficient and allow users to complete tasks quickly and easily.
Accessibility: The UI should be accessible to all users, including users with disabilities.
I believe that my UI designs were successful because they are clear, consistent, efficient, and accessible. I also used a variety of design elements, such as charts and graphs, to make the app's UI more engaging and informative.

How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those be applied in the future?

I approached the process of coding my app in the following way:

I first started by creating a design document that outlined the app's requirements and features.
I then broke down the app into smaller components and started coding each component one at a time.
I used a variety of programming techniques and strategies, such as object-oriented programming, modularity, and error handling.
I also used a number of open source libraries and frameworks to help me develop the app.
I believe that the techniques and strategies I used to code the app could be applied in the future to develop other mobile apps. For example, the use of object-oriented programming and modularity makes the code more reusable and maintainable. The use of error handling makes the app more robust and less likely to crash. And the use of open source libraries and frameworks can save a lot of time and effort.

How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important and what did it reveal?

I tested my code using a variety of methods, including:

Unit testing: Unit testing is a type of testing that involves testing individual units of code, such as functions and classes.
Integration testing: Integration testing is a type of testing that involves testing how different units of code work together.
System testing: System testing is a type of testing that involves testing the entire app as a whole.
Testing is important because it helps to ensure that the code is functional and free of errors. The testing I did revealed a number of minor bugs in my code, which I was able to fix before releasing the app.

Considering the full app design and development process, from initial planning to finalization, where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?

One challenge I faced during the app design and development process was implementing the database functionality. I had never used SQLite before, so I had to learn how to use it from scratch. I was able to overcome this challenge by reading the SQLite documentation and watching some tutorials online.

Another challenge I faced was designing the UI for the app. I wanted to create a UI that was both user-friendly and visually appealing. I was able to overcome this challenge by using
